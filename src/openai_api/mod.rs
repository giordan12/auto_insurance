// Here is where we will define a basic rust api to reach out to the chat completion api
// of openai as explained here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create
// From what I see we want to define a basic url, a way to pass the authorization token,
// specify the model to use, a system prompt and the user initial chat. Then we want to be able
// to handle the output. From this I think we only want the content of the response for now at least.
